# d2l-organizations

This is the `hybrid` branch of the `d2l-organizations` components. These are Polymer 1/2 hybrid components, which will eventually be updated to Polymer 2+. If you're looking for Polymer 2 components, they're on the `master` branch.

It is expected that this branch and `master` will diverge somewhat significantly - once the LMS is able to use Polymer 2+, the components in the `hybrid` branch can be converted to Polymer 2 and added to `master`, after which the `hybrid` branch can be deleted.
